Build Small Urban Neighborhood Block map based on Unreal engine and connect Airsim UAV model. Import gym, Keras-RL and other environments and set weights, client, etc using Python.

The image data obtained in the environment are processed by neural network (NN) and an appropriate strategy is selected for training (e-Greedy & Deep Q Learning) -flying from the starting point to a single or multiple end points. Parameters (Traning Steps, NLAF, E-Greedy, etc.) were adjusted to train the model. Test to improve accuracy and time.
